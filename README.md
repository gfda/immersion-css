# immersion-css

Introduction to web front-end development using HTML, CSS and Github Pages.

For a week, the basic front-end concepts were taught by [Alura's](https://www.alura.com.br/artigos/imersao-css) mentors.
As a result, there was an increase in the portfolio, practical and applied knowledge about CSS and HTML.

## Result

Finally, it was possible to put the result on the air using Github Pages.
